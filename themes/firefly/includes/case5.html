My role here was entirely in front-end (client-facing) development, but it was still a big learning experience.</p>
<p>One major decision I got to make was to insist that the logo be a Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) instead of the original raster image. As a result, the aspect ratio could be easily changed, using simple CSS rules, depending on the size of the browser window. In addition, the SVG logo naturally looks nice and crisp on all devices.</p>
