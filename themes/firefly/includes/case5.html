My role here was entirely in front-end (client-facing) development, but it was still a big learning experience.</p>
<p>The one major decision I got to make was to insist that the logo be a Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) instead of the original raster image. As a result, the aspect ratio could be changed, using simple CSS rules, depending on the screen size it's being viewed on. In addition, the SVG logo naturally looks nice and crisp on all devices.</p>
