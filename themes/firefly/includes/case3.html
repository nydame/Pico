Even if there are a lot of details available, it is often best to let visitors browse what's available to get the big picture, then let them drill down for whatever they decide they'd like to pursue.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I designed a staff page gallery for The Body is Not an Apology to reveal information in 3 stages. Upon arrival at the page, the visitor sees a grid of faces. Hovering over or (on a touch-enabled device) tapping on a picture reveals the staff member's name and staff position. In the final stage, that person's biography is revealed with a double click or double tap.</p>
<p>Technical note: I hijacked WordPress' core gallery functionality so that the site's content producers could use the workflow they were used to when adding or removing staff pictures.</p>
