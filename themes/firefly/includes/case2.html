To achieve this, I built a theme for them from the ground up, starting only with a blank theme called <a href="//html5blank.com/" title="Learn more about htis starter theme">HTML5 Boilerplate</a>. Since this theme provides no layout, I was free to create something unique and utterly customized.</p>
<p>Responsive web design forces web professionals to think seriously about material that, on a desktop, full-width screen, would traditionally be placed in a sidebar. The issue, of course, is where to put that content on smaller, narrower screens. For this client, I decided to hide the sidebar by default on small screens, but allow visitors to make it slide into view with a simple tap.</p>
