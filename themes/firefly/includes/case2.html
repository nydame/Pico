<p><a href="https://oneearthsacredarts.com" title="Visit oneearthsacredarts.com"><img src="https://go-firefly.imgix.net/oesa.png" /></a>One Earth Sacred Arts, a community of artists in the San Francisco Bay Area, wanted a site that didn't look like anyone else's. To achieve this, I built a custom theme for them starting only with the very basic HTML5 Boilerplate theme. Since this theme provides no layout, I was free to create something unique and utterly customized.</p>
<p>Responsive web design forces web professionals to think seriously about material that, on a desktop full-width screen, would traditionally be placed in a sidebar. The issue, of course, is where to put that content on smaller, narrower screens. For this client, I decided to hide the sidebar by default on small screens, but allow visitors to reveal it with a simple tap.</p>
