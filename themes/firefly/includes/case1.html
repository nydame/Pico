Oh, and they needed it in a hurry. No problem!</p>

<p>Because WordPress has a big, passionate community of developers, lots of common problems have already been solved in the form of easy-to-install <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins" title="Explore the Plugin Repository at wordpress.org">plugins</a>. When a bespoke solution might take too long and be too costly, there is often a way to add a feature quickly through a plugin. For adding a community calendar, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-events-calendar/" title="The Events Calendar plugin by Modern Tribe">The Events Calendar</a> plugin by Modern Tribe was perfect.</p>

<p>Even when there is no budget for a designer, the <a href="https://www.studiopress.com/" title="Read about the Genesis family of WordPress themes">Genesis framework</a> gives developers the ability to create sites that are modern, uncluttered and responsive. For this client, I chose a theme that features a special landing page template, which renders an app-like experience on mobile phones. The theme also affords the ability to create columns of text for long, information-packed articles.</p>
